/**
 * A concurrency utility for coordinating request/response style exchanges between coroutines.
 *
 * The table maintains two sides of communication:
 * - **Send table**: holds values that represent requests ([VS]).
 * - **Receive table**: holds values that represent responses ([VR]).
 *
 * A request is initiated by calling [waitFor], which stores the request data and suspends
 * until a corresponding response is provided by [notify]. After completion (either by success
 * or timeout), both request and response entries are cleaned up automatically.
 *
 * ### Key Properties
 * - Identifiers are composed of two parts: [ID0] (outer) and [ID1] (inner).
 * - Each `(id0, id1)` pair may have at most **one active waiter** at a time.
 * - Requests and responses are timestamped internally to support cleanup.
 *
 * This abstraction is useful for modeling one-off message exchanges, such as
 * RPC-style request/response patterns or matching commands with replies.
 *
 * @param ID0 type of the outer identifier
 * @param ID1 type of the inner identifier
 * @param VS type of values stored in the send table (requests)
 * @param VR type of values stored in the receive table (responses)
 * @constructor optionally provide a [Clock] (defaults to [Clock.System]) for timestamping

     * - If a [timeout] is specified, the suspension will be cancelled after
     *   the given duration, and a [QuatiException.GatewayTimeout] is thrown.

     * ### Exclusivity
     * Only **one active waiter** is allowed per `(id0, id1)` pair.
